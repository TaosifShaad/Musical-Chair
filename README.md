An easy musical chair task where the participants will be moving while a music plays in the background. The music will be controlled using random numbers from 0-3. While the number is 1, music will be stopped and if the number of participants still in the game is n, the participant at position n/2 will be eliminated. Then, a chair will be removed and the player names who are still in the game will be printed.
